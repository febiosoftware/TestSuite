1/8th symmetrical representation of an inflating balloon.  A pressure of
0 units at time t=0 to 0.0045 units at t=1 is applied to the shell disk.

In order to have consistent results with multiple threads, the material parameter
E was changed from 1 to 10 and the pressure was increased to the limit before
the results became inconsistent.
