	prescribed x displacement of 2 at t=1.
Main Features:
	q4ans shells
	von-Mises-3d with b=3
Secondary Features:
Materials:
	solid mixture (neo-Hookean,continuous fiber distribution)
Degrees of Freedom: 271
Results
	Steps Completed: 15
	Equilibrium Iterations: 45
	Right Hand Evaluations: 60
	Siffness Reformations: 45
	Other:
		The maximum effective stress is 141 units at time t=1.
