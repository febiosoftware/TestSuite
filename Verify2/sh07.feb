Problem Description:
	1/8th symmetrical representation of an inflating balloon.  A pressure of
	0 units at time t=0 to -0.0045 units at t=1 is applied to the shell disk.
Main Features:
	Shells
	Pressure
Secondary Features:
	
Materials:
	Neo-Hookean
Degrees of Freedom: 301
Results:
	Steps Completed: 14
	Equilibrium Iterations: 143
	Right Hand Evaluations: 222
	Siffness Reformations: 21
	Other:
		The disk has a maximum z-displacement of 0.447 at time t=1.
Comments:
	In order to have consistent results with multiple threads, the material parameter
	E was changed from 1 to 10 and the pressure was increased to the limit before
	the results became inconsistent.
